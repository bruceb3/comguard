#> An example hook script to check the commit log message.
#> Called by "git commit" with one argument, the name of the file
#> that has the commit message.  The hook should exit with non-zero
#> status after issuing an appropriate message if it wants to stop the
#> commit.  The hook is allowed to edit the commit message file.
